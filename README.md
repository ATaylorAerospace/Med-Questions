# Medical Question Answering Dataset

## üíÅ**Overview:**

This dataset is a comprehensive collection of medical questions and answers, ranging from basic to complex. It's designed to fine-tune LLMs for medical question answering. Questions are categorized into anatomy, physiology, medicine, and more, and answers are concise and informative.

## üìñ**Examples:**

Here are examples of questions and answers from the dataset:

**Question:** What is the role of the liver in the human body?

**Answer:** The liver is an organ that is located in the upper right portion of the abdomen. It is responsible for a variety of important functions, including the production of bile, the digestion of fats, and the removal of waste products from the blood. The liver also plays a role in the metabolism of drugs and other substances in the body.

**Question:** What are the different bones in the human body?

**Answer:** The human body has three types of bones:

      - Long bones: These are the bones that make up the arms and legs. They are designed to support the body and allow for movement.
      - Short bones: These are the bones that make up the hands and feet. They are smaller and more delicate than long bones.
      - Flat bones: These are the bones that make up the skull and the ribs. They are designed to protect the body's internal organs from damage.

**Question:** What is the difference between a heart attack and a stroke?

**Answer:** A heart attack occurs when the blood flow to the heart is blocked, usually by a clot in one of the coronary arteries. This can cause damage to the heart muscle, and can be life-threatening.
A stroke occurs when the blood flow to the brain is blocked, usually by a clot or a hemorrhage. This can cause damage to the brain, and can result in loss of function or death.

## üíÅ**Additional Information:**

It is important to note that these are just a few examples of the types of questions and answers that can be found in the dataset. The dataset is intended to be a comprehensive resource for medical question answering, and it is designed to cover a wide range of medical topics and concepts.

## üßê**Best Practices for AI Training and Bias Mitigation:**

- The generative AI application should be fine-tuned on a large dataset of dissimilar medical question pairs in order to achieve optimal LLM performance.
- It is important to be aware of the potential for bias in generative AI applications. Steps should be taken to mitigate bias in the training data and in the fine-tuning process.
