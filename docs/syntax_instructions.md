## Syntax Instructions for Creating a Medical Question Answering Dataset

### 1. Introduction

These syntax instructions will guide you through the process of creating a medical question answering dataset in Weaviate and fine-tuning a generative AI application that uses Med-Palm 2 as the LLM.

### 2. Dataset Creation

To create the dataset, you will need to:

- Prepare the data: The data for the medical question answering dataset should be in a format compatible with Weaviate. This includes creating a data schema, defining the properties of the data, and uploading the data to Weaviate.
- Define the training and evaluation datasets: The training and evaluation datasets for the medical question answering dataset should be separate from each other and should contain a sufficient amount of data to train and evaluate the model.
- Split the data into training and evaluation sets: The training and evaluation datasets should be split into training and evaluation sets, with a ratio of 80:20 or 90:10.

### 3. Model Fine-Tuning

To fine-tune the model, you will need to:

- Select the model: The model for the medical question answering dataset should be a generative AI model that is trained on a large amount of data and can generate accurate and relevant answers to medical questions.
- Prepare the model: The model should be prepared for fine-tuning by being trained on a large amount of data and then fine-tuned on a smaller dataset.
- Define the training and evaluation metrics: The training and evaluation metrics for the medical question answering dataset should be defined in order to evaluate the performance of the model.
- Split the data into training and evaluation sets: The training and evaluation datasets should be split into training and evaluation sets, with a ratio of 80:20 or 90:10.

### 4. Model Training

To train the model, you will need to:

- Select the training data: The training data for the medical question answering dataset should be a subset of the overall dataset and should contain a sufficient amount of data to train the model.
- Define the training and evaluation metrics: The training and evaluation metrics for the medical question answering dataset should be defined in order to evaluate the performance of the model.
- Train the model: The model should be trained on the training data, using the defined training and evaluation metrics.

### 5. Model Evaluation

To evaluate the model, you will need to:

- Select the evaluation data: The evaluation data for the medical question answering dataset should be a subset of the overall dataset and should contain a sufficient amount of data to evaluate the model.
- Define the evaluation metrics: The evaluation metrics for the medical question answering dataset should be defined in order to evaluate the performance of the model.
- Evaluate the model: The model should be evaluated on the evaluation data, using the defined evaluation metrics.

### 6. Model Deployment

To deploy the model, you will need to:

- Select the deployment platform: The deployment platform for the medical question answering dataset should be a platform that is compatible with Weaviate and can host the model.
- Prepare the model: The model should be prepared for deployment by being trained on a large amount of data and then fine-tuned on a smaller dataset.
- Deploy the model: The model should be deployed on the deployment platform, using the defined training and evaluation metrics.

### 7. Model Maintenance

To maintain the model, you will need to:

- Monitor the performance of the model: The performance of the model should be monitored over time to ensure that it is accurate and relevant.
- Update the model: The model should be updated as new data becomes available to ensure that it is accurate and relevant.
- Retrain the model: The model should be retrained as new data becomes available to ensure that it is accurate and relevant.
